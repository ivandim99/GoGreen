##### **25/02/2019  |  Sprint Review  |  week 2**

#### - Sprint Goal
We achieved our sprint goal from last week and finished the demo 1 on time.

#### - What went wrong
Sometimes it was not very clear what everyone was doing or supposed to do.
The reason for this is probably that we are really in the beginning of the project.
There was no application or what so ever so the start is always difficult.
From now on we will be able to hand out tasks to everyone so everyone knows exactly what to do.

#### - What did go well?
Everyone was on time in the meeting (except the 2 persons who never attended a meeting).
We also met on friday last week to work on the project, this worked out great so we will try to do this more.
