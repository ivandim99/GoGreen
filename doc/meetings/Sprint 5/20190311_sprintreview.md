##### **11/03/2019  |  Sprint Review  |  week 5**

#### - Sprint Goal
We achieved our sprint goal from last week and finished the demo 2 on time.

#### - What went wrong
It is not easy to answer this, 
everyone did a great job, 
if I had to say something negative it would be that,
we are all of us focusing always in the same things,
so we are not organizing the work that well.

#### - What did go well?
Everyone was on time in the meeting (except the 2 persons who never attended a meeting).
We also met on thursday last week to work on the project, this worked out great so we will try to do this more.
We are getting everything to work so it should be fine.
